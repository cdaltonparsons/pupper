Dog parks can be chaotic and overwhelming or just not the right setting for your dog to enjoy play. This is where Pupper steps in. Pupper is an app that takes in information about your dog and matches them with other dogs so that you can arrange a playdate. 
    This app allows you to login using a unique email address and password, 
    Once you have logged in, you will fill out two surveys, one for your dog and one for the types of dogs you'd like to meet
    From those surveys, the app filters our database to find dogs matching the types of dogs you'd like to meet.
    It will display those matches, and allow you to email the owners to get more information/schedule playdates
